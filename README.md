# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/123) goal.

## Installation and Setup
  Step 1 Clone the git hub repo at the following link https://github.com/zezemanolo/core-algorithms.
  Step 2 Change directories to core-algorithms and run npm install (to install dependencies).
  Step 3 Run the command `npm run test` to view mocha testing!

## Usage and Examples
Algorithms are used to exercise your brain and better prepare a developer for tech interviews!

Our test cases test what each algorithm should return and in some cases how the algorithm interprets falsey values.

Happy mathing!
